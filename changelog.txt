[1.10.0] - The initial release

    - added a TypeScript type declaration file so the in-IDE documentation and type safety is even better than before (thanks to @canarado)
    - added the class `FolderDaemon` to supervise a directory for changed files
    - added functions
        - `reserialize()` to copy a JSON-compatible object by value and lose the reference

        - `http.pipeString()` to stream a string into an http request
        - `http.pipeFile()` to stream a file into an http request
        - `http.getClientEncoding()` to get the encoding method a client requested
    - added the `rst` property to `colors.fg` and `colors.bg`
