# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability:
To report a vulnerability or security issue, please directly contact us via [E-Mail](mailto:%63%6F%6E%74%61%63%74%40%73%76%34%34%33%2E%6E%65%74?subject=SvCoreLib%20security%20issue) or [Discord](https://dc.sv443.net/)  
Please **do not** create a GitHub issue!

## Supported Versions:
Only the latest minor version is supported and will be receiving security updates  
For example, if the current version is v1.12.5, all versions from v1.12.0 up to v1.12.5 will receive security updates  
In case a security vulnerability was found and is patched, the affected versions will be marked as deprecated and a new patch will be released. In the above example that would be v1.12.6  
When using the install or update command, NPM should automatically update SvCoreLib. If not, simply use the command `npm i svcorelib@latest` (or substitute `latest` with the desired version number)
