# SvCoreLib
### This is a core dependency of all of my Node.js projects and a continuation of [JSLib-npm](https://github.com/Sv443/JSLib-npm)
Although it is intended for my own projects, feel free to use this library (make sure to follow [the license terms](https://sv443.net/LICENSE) though)

## Install:
Use this command in a terminal window inside your Node.js project:
```
npm i svcorelib
```

<br><br>

## Most notable features:
- interactive CLI tools like a menu and a progress bar
- networking tools like downloading files and pinging URLs or efficiently serving data to a connecting client
- file system tools like reading a directory recursively or supervising a directory for changes
- randomization tools like generating UUIDs or a seeded RNG
- misc tools like complex mathematics and array manipulation

## Dependencies:
I coded SvCoreLib so it needs as few dependencies as possible, but in order to ensure quality and stability, these dependencies are needed:
- [deep-diff](https://npmjs.com/package/deep-diff)
- [fs-extra](https://npmjs.com/package/fs-extra)
- [minimatch](https://npmjs.com/package/minimatch)
