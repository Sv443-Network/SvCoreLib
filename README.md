# SvCoreLib
### This is a core dependency of all of my Node.js projects and a continuation of [JSLib-npm](https://github.com/Sv443/JSLib-npm)
Although it is intended for my own projects, feel free to use this library (make sure to follow [the license terms](https://sv443.net/LICENSE) though)

## Most notable features:
- interactive CLI tools like a menu and a progress bar
- networking tools like downloading files and pinging URLs
- file system tools like reading a directory recursively
- randomization tools like generating UUIDs or a seeded RNG
- misc tools like complex mathematics and array manipulation
