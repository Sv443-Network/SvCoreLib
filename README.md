# SvCoreLib
### This is a core dependency of all of my Node.js projects and a continuation of [JSLib-npm](https://github.com/Sv443/JSLib-npm)
Although it is intended for my own projects, feel free to use this library (make sure to follow [the license terms](https://sv443.net/LICENSE) though)

## [Click here to go to the documentation](./docs.md)

<br><br>

## Install:
Use this command in a terminal window inside your Node.js project:
```
npm i svcorelib
```

<br><br>

## Most notable features:
- interactive CLI tools like a menu and a progress bar
- networking tools like downloading files and pinging URLs or efficiently serving data to a connecting client
- file system tools like reading a directory recursively, downloading a file or supervising a directory for changes
- randomization tools like generating UUIDs or a seeded RNG
- misc tools like relatively complex mathematics and array manipulation
